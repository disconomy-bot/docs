# Getting started!

Welcome to the Getting Started page of the docs! In this section, I will cover how to begin with the bot and start making money!

*Remeber, Disconomy's economy is global!*

Disconomy is a unique, decentralized economy bot where you, the users, control the market. It has a vast array of features ranging from investing in the stock market (with real, live data) to creating your own factory.

## Section 1: Key Features

First I will explain some of the key features of the bot that are important to note!

### Flags

If you run a command, and it says `flags is a required argument that us missing`, you can either look into the error message to see the flags, or run the `e!help {command}` command to see what the flags are. Example: If I am trying to run the `e!jobs requested` command to see the jobs requested, I need the business flag. I would run `e!jobs request --biz goose inc`

### Skills

Skills are a very important part of the bot! To see your skills, run the `e!skills` command. Skills help you in many things, for example speed helps in the factory `e!work` command, strength helps with mine `e!work` command, and hacking helps with the robbing banks and well as the security job position! To upgrade skills, do `e!skills buy {skill_name} {amount, default=1}`. The amount per skill increases exponentially every skill you buy!

## Section 2: Getting Started

Now I will show you the basic commands and how to work the bot!

### Balance

To see your balance, it's very simple! Run the `e!bal` command to see how much money is in your wallet and bank.

### Banks

When first using the bot, you are automatically in the central bank. All money in the central bank has a -4% interest on it, and when your starting and may not have a lot of money, that can be a lot. To join a private bank, run the `e!bank join {bank}`. There may be a signup fee, but we suggest paying it, because you will not lose money from storing it in the bank.
