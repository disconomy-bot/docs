# Making money!

Welcome to the Making Money page of the docs! In this section, I will cover how to begin making money with the bot and start working!

## Section 1: Jobs

### Finding A Job
The `e!jobs available {position}` shows you all the available jobs with the title you want. It also shows you the wage the company pays. Please note, you are not automatically accepted to the position, so don't run the `e!work` command until you are sure you are!

### Applying For A Job

The steady way to make money, is of course, a job. You can apply for a job by using the `e!job apply {position} {business}` command. All the job positions are: `laborer, staffmanager, supplymanager, financier`. You may apply for a job at any company a user has made. Also, remember the business you apply to has to accept your application, so wait to run the `e!work` command until you know you have been accepted. To check your job, run the `e!job` command.

## Section 2: Investments

### Investing Your Money

A slightly riskier way to make some money is through investments! It is based on real cryptocurrency & stock market current values. Buy low and sell high is the way to make money here. You can view all current crypto values [here](https://www.binance.com/en/markets) and all stock market values [here](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets). It also uses the real amount of money it would cost in the real world! 

#### Investing In Crypto

To invest in cryptocurrencies, you must get the symbol name from Binance. To do this, search up `{crypto name} binance ticker`. it will generally end in USDT. For example, if you look for bitcoin, it will be BTCUSDT. Then, add BINANCE: in front of it.
Ex: Bitcoin = BINANCE:BTCUSDT
The command is: `e!invest buy {name of currency} {amount}`

You can also add the `--dollars` flag on the end of the command if you want to specify the amount of money and not the amout of crypto you want to buy.
Ex. `e!invest buy {name of currency} --dollars {amount of money}`

#### Investing In Stocks

The command is: `e!invest buy {name of currency} {amount}`. 
Below, I buy 693 dollars in shares of the AMD stock. Note, when buying stocks, you can only buy when the market it open. The market is open 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, except stock market holidays.

You can also add the `--dollars` flag on the end of the command if you want to specify the amount of money and not the amout of stock you want to buy.
Ex. `e!invest buy {name of currency} --dollars {amount of money}`

### Selling Your Stocks/Crypto

Once you have bought some stocks or crypto, you can run the `e!invest list` command to see all of the stocks and crypto you have. When you are ready to sell, you can run the `e!invest sell {name of currency} {amount}`

## Section 3: Rob/Bank Rob

This is a very risky way to make money! This involves making money by stealing it off of other users/banks. It relies on a users skills more than anything. The `e!rob {user}` command relies on strength and speed, (one to get the money, the other to run away). The `e!bank rob {bank}` command relies on hacking. The higher hacking level, the longer you have to hack in and take the money and the bigger the payout!
