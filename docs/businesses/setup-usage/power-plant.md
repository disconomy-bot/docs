## **Section 2: Creation and Operation**
To create a power plant, you will first need **$110,000** and another **$7,500** to purchase your first **Oil Burner** (More info about Oil Burner later)

### **Creation**
- Once you have **$110,000** and are ready to create a power plant, simply run the command `e!plant create {name}`.
  **Again, please keep in mind that once a power plants name has been set, it cannot be changed.**

### **Operation** (Electric Plants)
- After creating a power plant, you must now acquire some oil and a oil burner to be fully operational. Start by purchasing an oil burner. Run the command `INSERT COMMAND`. This will cost roughly $7,500 (prices may vary in the market)

- When you have gotten at least 1 oil burner, it's now time to get some oil. Buying from a source is cheaper than getting oil from the shop. Run `e!buy list oil` and purchase some oil from a cheap source. 


### **Operation** (Nuclear Plants)

## **Wages**
Power Plants are not based off any skills obtained from `e!skills`. This business entirely depends on the workers' click speed. When setting wages or hiring, ensure to get fast clickers.

Starting Wage should be something low then progressively increase based on a workers usefulness.
